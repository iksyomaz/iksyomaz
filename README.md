# 👋 Hi, I’m @iksyomaz

- 👀 I’m interested in data-driven applications, esports analytics, and building things that make stats more human.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about backend optimization, deployment with Render, and advanced match data analysis using the Riot Games API.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to gaming, data visualization, or anything that makes dev tools more fun to use.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksander-zamoyski) or open an issue/PR on one of my repos!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a script that auto-pulled my League match stats *just* to settle an argument with my duo partner (spoiler: I was right 😎)
